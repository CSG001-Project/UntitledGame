# Best Practices
- **Always** pull before pushing: Avoid conflicts by pulling the latest changes before pushing your work.
- Write clear commit messages: Describe what your changes do and why they are necessary.
- Communicate with your team: Let others know when you're working on a file to avoid overlapping changes.
